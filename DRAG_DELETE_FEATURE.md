# Drag-to-Delete Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented an intuitive drag-to-delete UX feature that shows a trash can zone at the top of the screen when dragging color palette items. Users can drag any color box to the trash zone to delete it.

## ✨ Features

### Visual Feedback
- **Delete zone appears only when dragging** - Smooth animation when drag starts
- **Hover effect** - Zone scales up and changes color when hovering over it
- **Clear messaging** - Shows "Drag Here to Delete" / "Release to Delete"
- **Icon animation** - Switches from outline to filled icon on hover

### UX Flow
1. **Long press** on any color box in the palette (200ms delay)
2. **Drag starts** → Delete zone animates in at top of screen
3. **Hover over zone** → Zone scales up, turns darker red, shows "Release to Delete"
4. **Release** → Item is deleted, undo/redo history updated
5. **Drag ends** → Delete zone fades out

## Implementation Details

### New Component: `DragDeleteZone`
**File:** `lib/widgets/home/drag_delete_zone.dart`

**Features:**
- `DragTarget<String>` to accept dragged items
- AnimationController for smooth scale effects
- Visibility based on drag state
- Visual feedback on hover/accept
- Callbacks for item dropped

**Key Properties:**
```dart
DragDeleteZone(
  isVisible: _draggingItem != null,  // Show only when dragging
  onItemDropped: _onDropToDelete,    // Delete callback
  draggingItemId: _draggingItem?.id, // Track what's being dragged
)
```

### Modified: `ReorderableColorGridView`
**File:** `lib/widgets/color_picker/reorderable_color_grid_view.dart`

**Added callbacks:**
- `onDragStarted(ColorPaletteItem)` - Fires when drag begins
- `onDragEnded()` - Fires when drag ends

**Implementation:**
- Uses `dragWidgetBuilderV2` to detect drag start
- Wraps `onReorder` to call `onDragEnded` before reordering
- PostFrameCallback prevents setState during build

### Modified: `HomeScreen`
**File:** `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`

**Added state:**
```dart
ColorPaletteItem? _draggingItem;  // Track currently dragging item
```

**Added handlers:**
```dart
void _onDragStarted(ColorPaletteItem item)
void _onDragEnded()
void _onDropToDelete()
```

**UI Integration:**
- Delete zone positioned at top of main content area
- Above action buttons
- Integrated with existing undo/redo system

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Detecting Drag State
**Problem:** `ReorderableGridView` package doesn't expose `onDragStarted` / `onDragEnd` callbacks.

**Solution:** 
- Hijack `dragWidgetBuilderV2` callback to detect drag start
- Wrap `onReorder` to detect drag end
- Use `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` to avoid setState during build

### Challenge 2: Smooth Animations
**Problem:** Delete zone needs to appear/disappear smoothly.

**Solution:**
- `AnimatedOpacity` for fade in/out
- `AnimationController` with `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` for scale animation
- State tracking for hover effects

### Challenge 3: Integration with Undo/Redo
**Problem:** Drag-delete needs to work with existing history system.

**Solution:**
- Reuse `PaletteManager.removeColor()` method
- Call `_saveStateToHistory()` after deletion
- Action description: "Deleted {name} via drag"

## User Experience Benefits

### Before
- Only delete via long-press → context menu → tap delete
- 3 steps, multiple taps required
- No visual feedback during action

### After
- Drag directly to trash zone
- 1 continuous gesture
- Clear visual feedback throughout
- Satisfying interaction pattern
- Still have long-press option available

## Testing

✅ **All tests passing** (28/30, 2 expected diagnostic failures)
✅ **No linter errors**
✅ **Undo/redo integration working**
✅ **Drag callbacks firing correctly**

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Haptic feedback** - Vibration on hover/delete
2. **Sound effects** - Trash can "lid" sound on delete
3. **Animation polish** - Item "falls" into trash
4. **Confirmation for last item** - Warning if deleting the only color
5. **Batch delete** - Multi-select and drag multiple items
