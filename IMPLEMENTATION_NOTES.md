# Implementation Notes

## ReorderableGridView Fix

### Problem
When dragging color items in the palette, items would end up **one position before** their intended drop location. For example:
- Dragging "Blue" to appear after "Orange" would place it before "Orange" instead
- This made the UI feel unresponsive and confusing

### Root Cause
The issue was in the `_onPaletteReorder` method in `home_screen.dart`. The code was applying the standard Flutter `ReorderableListView` index adjustment:

```dart
if (oldIndex < newIndex) {
  newIndex -= 1;
}
```

However, the `reorderable_grid_view` package **already provides the correct target index** and doesn't require this adjustment.

### Solution
Removed the index adjustment logic:

```dart
/// Handle palette item reordering
void _onPaletteReorder(int oldIndex, int newIndex) {
  if (_isRestoringState) return;
  
  setState(() {
    // Note: ReorderableGridView package provides the exact target index
    // Unlike ReorderableListView, we do NOT need to adjust newIndex
    // Simply remove from oldIndex and insert at newIndex
    final item = _colorPalette.removeAt(oldIndex);
    _colorPalette.insert(newIndex, item);
    _saveStateToHistory('Reordered palette items');
  });
}
```

### Testing
Created comprehensive tests in `test/reorderable_grid_fix_test.dart` covering:
- Forward drags (left to right)
- Backward drags (right to left)
- Adjacent position swaps
- First to last and last to first moves
- Complex multi-step reordering sequences

All 7 tests pass ✓

## Complete Feature List

### 1. **ReorderableGridView** ✓
- Drag-and-drop color reordering
- 4-column responsive grid layout
- Visual drag feedback with scaling and opacity
- Placeholder indicator showing drop position
- Add button integrated into grid
- Empty state with helpful message
- **Fixed**: Correct index handling for precise drops

### 2. **Global Action Buttons** ✓
- **Copy**: Copy current color as hex to clipboard with preview
- **Paste**: Paste hex color from clipboard with preview
- **Eyedropper**: Pick colors from anywhere on screen using Cyclop

### 3. **Undo/Redo System** ✓
- Tracks all color changes and palette modifications
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+Z` (undo), `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (redo)
- Visual buttons showing availability
- Tooltips with action descriptions
- State snapshots include:
  - All palette items
  - Current color
  - Background color
  - Selection state
  - Timestamps and descriptions

### 4. **Color Management** ✓
- Individual color item editing
- Selection system with visual indicators
- Long-press for context menu with delete option
- Tap to select and edit
- Real-time color updates reflected in palette
- Hex code display on each color item

### 5. **Clipboard Service** ✓
- Parse multiple hex formats: `#RGB`, `#RRGGBB`, `#AARRGGBB`, `0xAARRGGBB`
- Validate color strings
- Handle shorthand notation (e.g., `#abc` → `#aabbcc`)
- Automatic alpha channel addition

### 6. **State Management** ✓
- Comprehensive state snapshots for undo/redo
- Prevent circular updates during state restoration
- History limit (50 states) to manage memory
- Clear separation between user actions and state restoration

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Package Choice**: Used `reorderable_grid_view: ^2.2.8` for native drag-drop support
2. **State Pattern**: Immutable snapshots for reliable undo/redo
3. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Models: Data structures
   - Services: Business logic
   - Widgets: UI components
   - Screens: State management
4. **Cyclop Integration**: Wrapped in `EyeDrop` widget at app root for global access

- `lib/main.dart` - Already had `EyeDrop` wrapper from Cyclop

## Usage

### Copy Color
1. Select or create a color
2. Click **Copy** button
3. Color hex value is copied to clipboard

### Paste Color
1. Copy a hex color from anywhere (e.g., `#FF5733`)
2. Click **Paste** button
3. Color is applied to current selection or as new color

### Pick Color
1. Click **Pick** button
2. Click anywhere on screen
3. Color is captured and applied

### Reorder Colors
1. Long-press and drag any color item
2. Move to desired position
3. Drop to reorder
4. **Now works correctly** - items drop exactly where you release them

### Undo/Redo
- **Undo**: `Ctrl+Z` or click undo button
- **Redo**: `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` or click redo button
- Tracks: color changes, additions, deletions, reordering

## Performance Considerations

- State snapshots are shallow copies of palette items
- History limited to 50 states (configurable)
- Clipboard checks are async and non-blocking
- Grid uses `ValueKey` for efficient rebuilds during reordering
